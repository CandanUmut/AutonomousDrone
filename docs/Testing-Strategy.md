# Testing Strategy

## Phases
1. **Simulation**: SITL and mission validation.
2. **Bench**: electronics, power, comms, and sensor tests.
3. **Tether**: controlled power-on checks.
4. **First flight**: low-risk flight envelope.
5. **Envelope expansion**: controlled increase in performance.
6. **Mission demo**: end-to-end scenario.

## Go/No-Go gates
- Simulation passes for core missions.
- Bench tests show stable power, comms, and sensor behavior.
- Safety checklists completed and signed.

## Artifacts
- Test cards
- Logs and telemetry
- Incident and anomaly reports
