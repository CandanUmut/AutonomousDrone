# Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Fixed-wing + Launch Assist | Tailsitter VTOL | Hybrid Lift + Cruise |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feasibility | 5 (simpler build) | 3 (complex transitions) | 3 (more systems) |
| Cost | 4 (lower parts count) | 3 (additional hardware) | 2 (dual propulsion) |
| Safety | 4 (predictable flight) | 3 (transition risk) | 3 (more failure modes) |
| Regulatory friction | 4 (VLOS fixed-wing) | 3 (more complex) | 3 |
| Time-to-demo | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| Scalability | 3 | 4 | 4 |
| Differentiation | 3 | 4 | 4 |

**Chosen MVP:** Fixed-wing with launch assist and belly landing.

**Justification:** Balances safety, cost, and time-to-demo for a small team, while meeting v1 range and payload targets. CITATION-TODO.
