# Autonomy Stack

## Layered autonomy
- **Autopilot (PX4 or ArduPilot)**: stabilization, navigation, basic failsafes.
- **Companion compute (ROS2 optional)**: mission manager, perception modules.
- **Ground control**: mission upload, monitoring, and logs.

## v1 autonomy scope
- Waypoint mission execution
- Return-to-home on lost link
- Geofence enforcement
- Basic landing or controlled descent

## v2 considerations
- Advanced perception and obstacle awareness
- Multi-vehicle coordination
