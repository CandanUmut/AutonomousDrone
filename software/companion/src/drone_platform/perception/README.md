# Perception (v2 scope)

Perception is intentionally limited in v2. We only define interfaces that future
implementations can extend.

## Interfaces
- Camera discovery and configuration
- Frame capture hooks for simulation playback
- Placeholder pipeline for detection/segmentation (no implementation)
