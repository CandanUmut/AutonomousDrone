# Next-Gen Autonomous Drone Platform

Safety-first, open-source platform for a **Next-Gen Autonomous Drone** focused on **delivery/transport**, **emergency response**, and **site security/inspection** missions in the US. This repository is built for two parallel workstreams (hardware + software) and aims to enable a small team to prototype an MVP quickly and safely.

**What this is**
- A practical, engineering-focused blueprint for a small, safe autonomous aircraft platform.
- A living set of requirements, architecture, test plans, and compliance checklists.
- A two-team workflow that supports hardware and software development in parallel.

**What this is not**
- Not a weaponized system and not intended for harm. We explicitly prohibit weaponization or unsafe use.
- Not legal advice. Regulatory content is guidance and must be verified.

## v1 MVP Concept (Summary)
We propose a **fixed-wing airframe with launch assist (catapult/bungee) and belly landing** as the v1 MVP: it is cost-effective, efficient for range/endurance, and practical to prototype with a small team. This decision is aligned with the research report insights; where verification is needed, sections are marked **NEEDS VERIFICATION** or **CITATION-TODO**.

## Safety & Legal Disclaimer
This project is strictly **non-weaponized** and safety-first. Always follow all applicable laws and regulations, and operate responsibly. **Not legal advice.** Do not use this project for harmful or malicious purposes.

## Two-Team Workflow
- **Hardware Team:** airframe, propulsion, power, payload integration, safety hardware, compliance labelling.
- **Software Team:** autonomy stack, simulation, telemetry, mission control, data logging, safety logic.

See **hardware/README.md** and **software/README.md** for responsibilities, interfaces, and acceptance criteria.
